Description of the Power Control and System Information Application
Overview:
The Power Control and System Information Application is a desktop utility built using PyQt5 that provides users with convenient access to system management, power control, and system information tasks. The application features an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) with a black and white theme for a sleek, minimalist design. This app simplifies common tasks like shutting down, restarting, hibernating, and viewing system information, making it useful for both novice and advanced users.

Key Features:
Black and White Theme:

The application employs a modern, dark mode theme with black as the primary color for the background and white for the text. This provides a clean and professional look, ideal for users who prefer dark themes.

System Information Section:

The System Information section allows users to quickly access important system management tools. Each button in this section opens a specific tool or provides detailed system information. This includes:
System Information: Opens the Windows system information tool (msinfo32), displaying detailed hardware and software configuration data.
Device Manager: Launches the Device Manager (devmgmt.msc), where users can view and manage hardware devices and drivers.
System Properties: Opens the System Properties dialog (sysdm.cpl), allowing users to view and configure system settings.
Task Manager: Opens the Task Manager (taskmgr), where users can monitor running applications and system resource usage.
Command Line Info: Opens the Command Prompt and runs systeminfo, displaying system details such as the OS version, uptime, memory usage, and more.
DirectX Diagnostic: Launches the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (dxdiag), useful for diagnosing issues with multimedia and video.
Run Dialog: Opens a custom dialog where users can type and execute any command, providing the same functionality as the native Windows "Run" dialog.

Power Control Section:

The Power Options section provides users with buttons to control the power state of their system. The available options include:
Shutdown: Instantly shuts down the computer.
Shutdown Delay: Shuts down the computer after a 60-second delay.
Restart: Instantly restarts the computer.
Restart Delay: Restarts the computer after a 60-second delay.
Hibernate: Puts the computer into hibernation mode, saving the current session and powering off the system.
Sleep: Puts the computer into sleep mode, consuming minimal power while retaining the session in memory.
Abort: Cancels any pending shutdown or restart actions.

Custom Run Dialog:

The Run Dialog is a custom implementation that allows users to type and run system commands directly from the application. This feature mimics the Windows "Run" dialog, but with the convenience of being integrated into the application.
Responsive Design:

The application features a user-friendly, responsive design that makes navigation easy. Buttons are styled to be visually appealing, with a modern look and feel. Hover and press effects are implemented to provide clear feedback on interactions.
Exit Confirmation:

When users attempt to close the application, they are prompted with a confirmation dialog to avoid accidental closure. This adds an extra layer of control, ensuring that users don’t accidentally shut down the application or their system.
Technical Details:
Programming Language and Libraries:

The application is written in Python using the PyQt5 library for the graphical user interface (GUI).
Subprocess module is used to interact with system processes, ensuring seamless execution of system commands.
OS module is used to issue commands like shutdown and systeminfo directly from the Python code.
Application Layout:

The main window is divided into two sections: the System Information section and the Power Options section. Each section is vertically arranged, ensuring clarity and ease of use.
The window’s design is minimalistic, focusing on functionality with clearly labeled buttons and a consistent font styling for titles and buttons.
Customization:

The theme colors (black background with white text) and button styles can easily be customized by adjusting the QPalette and the button’s QPushButton stylesheets.
Platform Compatibility:

This application is designed for Windows systems, as the system commands (shutdown, devmgmt.msc, msinfo32, etc.) are specific to the Windows operating system.
Use Cases:
System Administrators:

The application provides a quick and easy way for system administrators to access vital system tools and control the power states of the machines they manage.
Regular Users:

Users who frequently use the command prompt or system information tools will find this app highly convenient as it reduces the need to memorize and type long commands.
Power Users:

For power users who need to automate system restarts, shutdowns, or access system diagnostics, this app provides an all-in-one solution without the need for multiple windows or navigating through menus.
Future Improvements:
Adding functionality to schedule shutdowns, restarts, and hibernations.
Implementing user preferences for customizing themes and button configurations.
Adding cross-platform support for Linux and macOS, enabling similar functionality across different operating systems.
This application delivers a user-friendly experience, combining powerful system management tools with an intuitive interface. It is perfect for users looking to streamline their system administration tasks while maintaining control over their system's power management.
